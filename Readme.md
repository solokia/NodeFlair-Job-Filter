# Filtering Nodeflair jobs

Nodeflair has the ability to filter by quite a lot of things  
But the functionality of filters is still quite limited in some sense that you cannot filter by !company  
And there is also the limit of how many offers per page  
Currently this script just scrap based off the normal filter that is given by Nodeflair  
After which the output is a csv file to throw into excel for easier filter

May continue to work on this adding in additional filters or do some analysis on this.
